 Problem:    paint house
 Difficulty: Easy
 Notes:

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[][] costs) {
        if(costs == null || costs.length == 0 ) return 0;
        int n = costs.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][3];
        dp[0][0] = costs[0][0];
        dp[0][1] = costs[0][1];
        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];
        for(int i = 1; i < n  ; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.min(dp[i-1][1] + costs[i][0], dp[i-1][2] + costs[i][0]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.min(dp[i-1][0] + costs[i][1], dp[i-1][2] + costs[i][1]);
            dp[i][2] = Math.min(dp[i-1][0] + costs[i][2], dp[i-1][1] + costs[i][2]);
        }
        return Math.min(dp[n-1][0], Math.min(dp[n-1][1],dp[n-1][2]));
    }
